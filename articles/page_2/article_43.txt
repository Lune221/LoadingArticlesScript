AbstractAntibodies against the wheat storage globulin Glo-3A from a patient with both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease were enriched to identify potential molecular mimicry between wheat antigens and T1D target tissues. Recombinant Glo-3A was used to enrich anti-Glo-3A immunoglobulin G antibodies from plasma by batch affinity chromatography. Rat jejunum and pancreas, as well as human duodenum and monocytes were probed, and binding was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. Glo-3A-enriched antibodies bound to a specific subset of cells in the lamina propria of rat jejunum that co-localized mostly with a marker of resident, alternatively activated CD163-positive (CD163(+)) macrophages. Blood monocytes and macrophage-like cells in human duodenum were also labelled with the enriched antibodies. Blocking studies revealed that binding to CD163+ macrophages was not due to cross-reactivity with anti-Glo-3A antibodies, but rather to non-Glo-3A antibodies co-purified during antibody enrichment. The novel finding of putative autoantibodies against tolerogenic intestinal CD163(+) macrophages suggests that regulatory macrophages were targeted in this patient with celiac disease and T1D.
