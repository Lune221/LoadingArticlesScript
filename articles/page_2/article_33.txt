AbstractLeaf rust (LR) and yellow rust (YR), caused by Puccinia triticina and Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, respectively, are important diseases of wheat. Quaiu 3, a common wheat line developed at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), is immune to YR in Mexico despite seedling susceptibility to predominant races. Quaiu 3 also shows immunity to LR in field trials and is known to possess the race-specific gene Lr42. A mapping population of 182 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed by crossing Quaiu 3 with susceptible Avocet-YrA and phenotyped with LR and YR in field trials for 2 years in Mexico. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with YR and LR resistance in the RILs were identified using Diversity Arrays Technology and simple sequence repeat markers. A large-effect QTL on the long arm of chromosome 2D explained 49-54 % of the phenotypic variation in Quaiu 3 and was designated as Yr54. Two additional loci on 1BL and 3BS explained 8-17 % of the phenotypic variation for YR and coincided with previously characterized adult plant resistance (APR) genes Lr46/Yr29 and Sr2/Yr30, respectively. QTL on 1DS and 1BL corresponding to Lr42 and Lr46/Yr29, respectively, contributed 60-71 % of the variation for LR resistance. A locus on 3D associated with APR to both diseases explained up to 7 % of the phenotypic variance. Additional Avocet-YrA-derived minor QTL were also detected for YR on chromosomes 1A, 3D, 4A, and 6A. Yr54 is a newly characterized APR gene which can be combined with other genes by using closely linked molecular markers.
