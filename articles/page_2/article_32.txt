AbstractWheat leaf rust is a destructive foliar disease of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. The most effective, economical s to control the disease is growing resistant cultivars with adult plant resistance (APR). The Chinese wheat lines W014204 and Fuyu 3 showed high leaf rust resistance in the field. To identify leaf rust APR genes in the two lines, two mapping populations with 215 and 163 F-2:3 lines from the crosses W014204/Zhengzhou 5389 and Fuyu 3/Zhengzhou 5389, respectively, were phenotyped for leaf rust severities during the 2010-2011, 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 cropping seasons in the field at Baoding, Hebei Province, China. A total of 1 215 SSR markers were used to identify the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for leaf rust APR in the two populations. In the W014204/Zhengzhou 5389 population, three QTLs were detected and designated as QLr.hbu-1BL.1, QLr.hbu-2BS.1 and QLr.hbu-7DS, and explained 2.9-8.4, 11.5-38.3 and 8.5-44.5% of the phenotypic variance, respectively; all the resistance alleles at these loci were derived from W014204. In the Fuyu 3/Zhengzhou 5389 population, three QTLs, QLr.hbu-1BL.2, QLr.hbu-2BS.2 and QLr.hbu-7BL, explained 12.0-19.2, 22.3-38.9 and 4.1-4.3% of the phenotypic variance, respectively, and all resistance alleles were contributed by Fuyu 3. Based on chromosome positions of closely linked markers, both QLr.hbu-1BL.1 and QLr.hbu-1BL.2 are Lr46, and QLr.hbu-7DS is Lr34. QLr.hbu-7BL was mapped on chromosome 7BL near to Lr68 and they are likely the same gene. Based on chromosome positions, pedigree and field reactions, the two 2BS QTLs are different from all the known APR genes and are likely to be new APR QTL for leaf rust. These QTLs and their closely linked markers are potentially useful for improving leaf rust resistance in wheat breeding.
