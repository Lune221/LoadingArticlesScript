AbstractMore than 100 resistance genes against wheat rust pathogens have been described in wheat and its relatives. Although many of them have been extensively used in wheat resistance breeding, none of these resistance loci has yet been analyzed at the molecular revel. By screening a set of near-isogenic lines carrying different leaf rust resistance genes with a wheat probe encoding a serine/threonine protein kinase, we detected a polymorphic DNA fragment in the line with the Lr10 resistance gene. This fragment mapped to the Lr10 disease resistance locus and encodes a receptor-like protein kinase which we called LRK10. LRK10 contains a new type of extracellular domain not found in known plant or animal receptor kinases. Several conserved amino acids in S-domain glycoproteins and receptor-like kinases were also found in LRK10, suggesting that LRK10 and S-domain proteins belong to the same superfamily of specific recognition molecules in plants. Lrk10 was expressed at low revels in young seedlings and belongs to a gene family. Analysis of wheat lines with and without the Lr10 gene demonstrated that Lrk10 and Lr10 belong td the same genetic locus. We conclude that gene isolation based on protein kinase homology can identify new receptor domains and provide candidates for disease resistance genes in the complex wheat genome.
