AbstractStagonospora nodorum is a foliar pathogen of wheat that produces several host-selective toxins (HSTs) and causes the disease Stagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB). The wheat genes Snn1 and Tsn1 confer sensitivity to the HSTs SnTox1 and SnToxA, respectively. The objectives of this study were to dissect, quantify, and compare the effects of compatible Snn1-SnTox1 and Tsn1-SnToxA interactions on susceptibility in the wheat-S. nodorum pathosystem. Inoculation of a wheat doubled haploid population that segregates for both Snn1 and Tsn1 with an S. nodorum isolate that produces both SnTox1 and SnToxA indicated that both interactions were strongly associated with SNB susceptibility. The Snn1-SnTox1 and Tsn1-SnToxA interactions explained 22 and 28% of the variation in disease, respectively, and together they explained 48% indicating that their effects are largely additive. The Snn1-SnTox1 interaction accounted for 50% of the variation when the population was inoculated with an S. nodorum strain where the SnToxA gene had been mutated, eliminating the Tsn1-SnToxA interaction. These results support the theory that the wheat-S. nodorum pathosystem is largely based on multiple host-toxin interactions that follow an inverse gene-for-gene scenario at the host-toxin interface, but disease exhibits quantitative variation due to the mainly additive nature of compatible interactions. The elimination of either Snn1 or Tsn1 toxin sensitivity alleles resulted in decreased susceptibility, but the elimination of both interactions was required to obtain high levels of resistance. We propose the use of molecular markers to select against Snn1, Tsn1, and other toxin sensitivity alleles to develop wheat varieties with high levels of SNB resistance.
