AbstractThree quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with adult plant resistance (APR) to powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis) in wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivar 'Massey' were mapped in a previous study. The three QTL were located on chromosomes 2A, 2B and 1B, and explained 50% of the total phenotypic variation. A 293 recombinant inbred line (RIL) breeding population (UJ) derived from the cross of 'USG 3209', a derivative of 'Massey', and 'Jaypee' was used to evaluate the potential effectiveness of marker-assisted selection (MAS) for APR. Powdery mildew severities of the 293 UJ RILs were evaluated in 2002 (F-5 : 6) and 2003 (F-6 : 7) under natural disease pressure in the field. The 293 RILs were also evaluated for disease severity in a 2004 (F-7 : 8) greenhouse experiment using a composite of five different isolates of B. graminis. Selection of RILs possessing the QTL on chromosome 2A, and to a lesser extent, the one on chromosome 1B was effective in identifying powdery mildew resistance in both greenhouse and field experiments. Overall, selecting RILs with QTL on chromosomes 2A and 2B was most successful in identifying highly resistant RILs, which had mean mildew severities of 4.4% and 3.2% in 2002 and 2003 field experiments, respectively. Breeders implementing MAS programs for APR to powdery mildew via selection of RILs containing the two QTL on chromosomes 2A and 2B likely will obtain RILs having high levels of resistance in the field, however combining all three QTL may ensure greater durability.
