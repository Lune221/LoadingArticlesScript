AbstractStripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is a serious disease of wheat. The spring wheat cultivar Kariega expresses complete adult plant resistance to stripe rust, whereas Avocet S is susceptible. In former studies, quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of doubled haploid lines derived from a Kariega x Avocet S cross revealed two major QTL (QYr. sgi-7D and QYr. sgi- 2B.1) and two minor QTL (QYr. sgi- 1A and QYr. sgi- 4A.1) responsible for the adult resistance of Kariega in the field. Avocet S contains none of these QTL. In the present study, stripe rust development was compared, by means of fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy, in flag leaves of Kariega, Avocet S and six doubled haploid (DH) lines, containing all four, none or one QTL. Depending on the QTL present, the infection types of the DH lines ranged from resistant to fully susceptible. No differences in fungal growth were observed during the first 5 days post inoculation (dpi), whereas the mean length of the fungal colonies started to differ at 6 dpi. Interestingly, MP 51 carrying QYr. sgi-7D responded with lignification to the fungal growth without restricting it, whereas MP 35 containing QYr.sgi-2B.1 did not show lignified host tissue, but fungal growth was restricted. RT PCR experiments with sequences of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins resulted in a slightly stronger induction of PR 1, 2 and 5, known markers for the hypersensitive reaction, and peroxidases in MP 51, whereas a second band for chitinases was detected in MP 35 only.
